#Framework<span id = "0"\>ï¼š
##Operating procedure<span id = "9"\>
The data/metadata will be stored as byte array. *StorageImpl* class will be responsible for fetch/put the byte array, in which both data and metadata are stored, out of/into the file. IndexHelperImpl will help *DBManager* to transform metadata into what we desire, that is a hash table whose key and value are the key for record and *Index* class, respectively. The more query and update will be executed by the *DBManager* class.

![GitHub Logo](uml.png)

The required functions--put, get and remove--are implemented within the *DBManager*. The *Index* will be modified after these operations. All these execution will happen in the main memory. Before the database is closed, all the *Index* in memory will be transformed back to byte array and then this array will be re-written into the disk.

##Metadata structure:<span id = "11"\>
 
### Storage-Metadata
Assumptions & decisions:

1. The start sign is one-byte number, which is -1. There is no other numbers--key, offset or length--to be negative. Any negative indexes are forbidden.
2. Pair list in the class *Index* are sorted. Every times *indextobytes()* are called, the pair list in an index will be sorted by L's value.
3. All the metadata will be converted into byte array. In this case, integer will be convert into 4 byte numbers. In other word, the key, offset and length all will be converted into 4 byte numbers. 
4. There will be a three-byte reserved space for each record. They will be active when it's necessary in the future.

#### indexMap:		
This is a hash table: *Map\<K, V\>*. This structure will be used in the main memory.
*K* is *Integer*, and *V* is a class of *Index*. indexMap will include the metadata in our database, and more detail will be stored in the class *Index*.
    
1. K represents for the key of a record. K will be an int type number, which is 32-bit or 4 bytes.
2. V is class *Index*. The record will also be treated as the instance of Index class, which has the same attribute key as K. type: int


#### *Index* class:  
This class will contain metadata of a certain record, which key and index pairs.

1. key represents for the key of a record
2. index pairs is a list of class *Pair*. 

#### *Pair* class: 
Pair class,*Pair\<L,R\>*, contains start position(or offset in data array) and length. Typically, one record will have one pair, but when free space are not available in whole multiple indexes are introduced to arrange the data into fragmental space. 	
L is for array offset in data array, and R is for the length of the respective record(or the fragment of that record). Both L and R are int number, which is 4 bytes.

### *Table-Metadata*
Assumptions & decisions:
1. The start sign is one-byte number, which is -2. Still, there is no other numbers to be negative. 

##Data storage form<span id = "13"\>
### Assumptions & decisions:
1. The data, whichever it is metadata or data itself, will be stored as byte array, which will be accessed by FileStream.
2. We store the data and metadata in two separated files, data.db and data.meta. The size of the data.db, which stores data, is constantly 4MB, while data.meta file could has a varied size.

#### byte array:		
Physical metadata storage form. The byte array will be transformed from indexMap when the data need to be stored into disk. Usually, every 16 bytes will be used for recording the metadata for each record, but this size will be varied because of fragment storage. The byte array's structure is shown as followed:
 	
|element|purpose|size|
|---|---|---|
|Start sign|identify record header|1 byte
|reserved bytes|reserved for unexpected situation|3 bytes|
|key|the key of the data|4 bytes
|*Pair* class|stored \<offset,length\> pairs|8*pair number bytes

Metadata of each record will be stored one by one all together.

|metadata 1|metadata 2|metadata ...|
|---|---|---|

Each metadata will have structure as followed:

|start_sign (1B)|reserved bytes (3B)|key (4B)|offset 1 (4B)|length 1 (4B)|offset 2 (4B)|length 2 (4B)|...
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| 


# Main classes<span id = "1"\>
####*Storage*<span id = "2"\>
This is an interface, which contains 2 attributes and 4 method. Storage play a role of write and read data and metadata. By using FileStream, these method can load all the data/metadata, in the form of byte array, into the main memory.  Its two attributes, which are *DATA_SIZE* and *METADATA_SIZE*, are responsible for the constraint of maximum data/metadata size.
#####method:

### Assumptions & decisions:

### Results

To validate our design, we conducted the following experiement. We first put 4 byte arrays with key 0,1,2,3 of size 1MB to the database. Then we removed key 1 and put 0.5 Mb for key 4. After that,  we put a 1 Mb data with key 5, which should result in a failure as there are not that much space left. Following that we removed key 2 and put 1 Mb with key 6 and a success is expected. Finally, we remove key 4 and wrote 1 Mb with key 7, and such attempt should be allowed. 

Below are the test run results from console.

![GitHub Logo](Fragmentation.png)

As you can see, the put attempt with key 5 failed while key 6 and 7 succeeded.

##Concurrency control<span id = "15"\>

### Assumptions & decisions:
1. Threads can only be read if no other threads has write accesses or in request of it.
2. Threads can write when no other threads are reading or writing the database.
3. When a thread is writing, it also has access to read.
4. Multiple read and write requests from a same thread is allowed.

#### Readlock:
A thread is granted read access to the database if : 

* It is the current writing thread. This is implemented by keeping track of the current writing thread.
* It has been granted read access already to ensure Read-Read Re-entrance. This is implemented by keeping a map called "readingThread" in the memory, where the key is the thread instance and the value is the count of read accesse.

Denied if :

* Other thread is writing. 
* There are threads waiting to write. This is implemented by counting the number of write requests.

The thread waits until such criterion is met. After that, it updates the readingThread Map and get data from the database. After query is complete, it updates the Map and notify other threads.

#### Writelock:
A thread with write requests first adds to the waitinglist. Then it is granted access to the database if :

* It is the only thread reading the data. (Auto Upgrade)
* No other thread is writing. 

Denied if :

* This thread is not the current writing thread.
* Has readers other than the current thread.

Jusr like the Readlock, the thread waits until such criterion is met. Then it increments the number of itself writing the data, decrement the waiting threads and set the current writing thread to itself so as to ensure later re-entrance. After writing the data, it decreases its current writing access to the database and updates the current writing thread attribute if needed. Finally, it notifies other threads.

### Result

To validate concurrency control over the database, we tried the following experiment: 

We wrote a class named Threadtest that can carry out a specific list of operations on the database according to the user's request. Then we instantiated several Threads of this and assigned different tasks to them. These tasks should be carried out in a sequence that follows our assumption and decisions of concurrency control.

There are three threads in our experiment, and named as Thread 1, 2 and 3. All threads are assigned the same key (key 11), but with different value. Thread 1's tasks are to read and remove; Thread 2's are to write and read; Thread 3 is scheduled to remove and write. Thread got 66051 , Thread 2 got 330255 and Thread 3 is 660510. For test purposes the key 11 is put with 66051 first.

Below are the test results:

![GitHub Logo](Concurrency.png)

From above we can see after all three threads hadstarted, the first task of Thread 1 and 3 are added, but Thread 3 locked the database first and removed key 11. Then Thread 2's first task and 3's second tasks are added while Thread 3 locked again and wrote its data to the database. Thread 2 then locked the writelock and updated the value mapped to key 11 (which is seen in above as remove first then put). After that, Thread 2's second task is added but Thread 1 locked the read lock first and got the data (which is Thread 2's pre-assigend value : 330255). Then Thread 1 removes the key 11 so when Thread 2 tries to read the data later, it got nothing.

# Further Assumptions in Project 2<span id = "16"\>

##Table-Metadata
We add a new type of metadata--table metadata--to store the table information so that multi-attribute based on project 1 can be implemented.	

###Assumptions:

1. Table metadata contains start sign, reserved bytes(3 bytes), table id, table name, attributes numbers, attribute names and lengths.
1. The start sign of table-metadata is one-byte number, which is -2. Still, there is no other numbers to be negative.
2. There are some reserved bytes, which could be used in an unexpected way and make flag searching efficient.
2. table id, is 4-byte integer and non-negative, so max table number is 2^31.
3. Table names will occupy 16 bytes, including 2-byte flags and max 14 table name length.
4. Attribute number is 4-byte integer and non-negative. 
5. Attribute names will occupy 16 bytes, including 2-byte flags and max 14 table name length.
6. Attribute type is 4 bytes and indicates the data type of the domain. We assumed 1 is int, and 0 is String.
4. Attribute length is 4-byte integer and non-negative. We also assumed that all the attributes have fixed length, so length may be pre-set.


#### Physical Structure
|start sign(1B)|reserved bytes(3B)|tab id(4B)|tab name(16B)|attribute 1(24B)|attribute 2(24B)|...
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
For each attribute:

|attribute name(16B)|attribute type(4B)|attribute length(4B)|
|---|---|---|
Every attribute/table name are divided into two parts, which are both 7 bytes.

|search flag(1B)|attribute/table name part 1(7B)|search flag(1B)|attribute/table name part 2(7B)|
|---|---|---|---|

#### Memory Structure
Table metadata:
> Map\<int tid, List\<Pair\> tableMeta\>
	
tableMetadata
> List\<Pair pairs\>

First pair in the list:
>Pair\<int tab\_id,String tab\_name\>

The rest of pairs:
>Pair\<String attribute\_name,Pair attribute\_info\_Pair\>

attribute\_info\_Pair\:
>Pair\<int attribute\_type, int attribute\_length\>

#### Table Metadata transformation
We add two more functions in IndexHelper to transform the physical metadata into memory, and from memory back to physical as well.

bytesToTabMeta()
Load table metadata from metadata byte array. This function needs to identify the correct metadata, which could be mixed with index metadata.
tabMateToBytes()
Return metadata array of table metadata, than when we write metadata into db file, this returned array will concat with index metadata.
##Relation And DbManager
For now, we assumed that we **only have one relation** in our database. We will add relation class in the future project. In other word, we don't have relation class now, and all the interface are under the class DBManager. We will finish this part in the next project.
##Attribute Index
Based on the project 1, we add three methods to realize the indexing mechanism with **Hash Table**. In the project 1, we have already realized clustered index, which is based on key, or rather rid. Now we need to construct unclustered index based on other attributes.
#### put
#### get
#### remove

We also add two methods, **hashtabToBytes()** and **bytesToHashtab()** to Indexhelper to transform index between memory and physical storage.

###Attribute Index structure 

##Condition
In order to validate the Index function, we consider to implement selection function based on the SQL where-condition. We have created a Condition class, which play a significant role in our query validation.
###main methods of condition 
**assertCondition()**		
Assert the conditions, transform string statement into string array and logic flags.	

**throwCondition()**		
Throw the condition values which are produced by assertCondition() method.

**handleCondition()**	
Handle the condition values returned by the throwCondition() and judge the condition is true of false.

**removeExtraSpace()**	
Remove the meaningless space in the string statement.

##Validation
Assumption:	

1. Since some attributes contain char ',', which is a separator for csv file, read data from csv file could be a problem. For simplicity, we use '@' as separator.
2. To store the data, we will convert the string into byte. We treat every character in String as ASCII code, so some uncommon char will be displayed as '?'. In other word, we did not handle the non-ASCII code character problem. 
2. We have implemented **SQL select statement** and **Create Index statement**, which is pretty closed to the real SELECT. Our SELECT can do PROJECT and SELECT job. SELECT function will be based on a new class Condition, which will convert a String statement into boolean value.
3. Our Condition class does not support bracket but support multiple logic and/or statement.

###validation instruction:
Here are our shell commends listed in the tables. Although some of them are validation in the first project including fragment storage and concurrency control. Although our SQL is simple, it contains most common usages, which are projection and equality selection. More functions and commands will provide in the next several projects.

In order to run the shell program, please run the DBTool.shell() function, or run the DBTool.main(). Type help will give you more help information.
